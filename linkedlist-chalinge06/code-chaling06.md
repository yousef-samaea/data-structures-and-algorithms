at this chalinge i needs to make three methods first method is append: used to append a node to the end of the linked list, and the second method is Insert After: used to insert a node before a specific location, and the finally method is Insert After: used to insert a node After a specific location.

### metods:

append: fines the last node then make the pointer point to the new nod
Insert After: check if the head is null if true then give the user a warning message if false then using while loop find the location i want to insert after then newnode.next =location. next then then make the pointer of location point to the new nod.
Insert After: check if the head is null if true then give the user a warning message if false then using while loop find the location i want to insert before it then newnode.next =location then then make the pointer of the node that exist before location point to the new nod

# Trees
Binary Tree is a data structure used as a data storage and its have a special storiging sistem that each node can have at most two children
only and they called Left and Right nods.

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a Binary Tree class And Define a method for each of the depth first traversals :

   1. pre order
   2. in order
   3. post order 

Create Add and Contains methods.


## API
pre order : which returns all of the values in the tree and ordered it like : root >> left >> right.
in order : which returns all of the values in the tree and ordered it like : left >> root >> right.
post order : which returns all of the values in the tree and ordered it like : left >> right >> root.
Add : Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains : Returns boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once
